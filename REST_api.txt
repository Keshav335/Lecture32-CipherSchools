REST(Representational State Transfer).

API(Application programming interface).

[REST API] is an API that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.

REST API will have 2 parts: 1.URL 2.HTTP method.

REST uses less bandwidth, making it more suitable for efficient internet usage. 

RESTful APIs can also be built with programming languages such as JavaScript or Python.

A RESTful API uses existing HTTP methodologies defined by the RFC 2616 protocol, such as:
[GET] to retrieve a resource;
[PUT] to change the state of or update a resource, which can be an object, file or block;
[POST] to create that resource; and
[DELETE] to remove it.
